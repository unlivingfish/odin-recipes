   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>Sticky and Easy Honey Garlic Chicken made fast and simple, with the most amazing 5-ingredient honey garlic sauce that is so good youâ€™ll want to use it on everything!</p>
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>6 chicken thighs, bone in or out, with or without skin*</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper, to season</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder, to season</li>
    <li>6 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
    <li>1/3 cup honey</li>
    <li>1/4 cup water (or chicken broth)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar (or apple cider vinegar, or any white vinegar)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
        <li>Season chicken with salt, pepper and garlic powder; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat a pan or skillet over medium high heat; sear chicken thigh fillets or breast fillets on both sides until golden and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat after searing on both sides, cover skillet with a lid and continue cooking until the chicken is cooked through, while turning every 5 minutes until done.</li>
        <li>Drain most of the excess oil from the pan, leaving about 2 tablespoons of pan juiced for added flavour.</li>
        <li>When chicken is done and cooked through, arrange chicken skin-side up in the pan (if cooking with skin); add the garlic between the chicken and fry until fragrant (about 30 seconds). Add the honey, water, vinegar and soy sauce. Increase heat to medium-high and continue to cook until the sauce reduces down and thicken slightly (about 3-4 minutes).</li>
        <li>Garnish with parsley and serve over vegetables, rice, pasta or with a salad.</li>
   </ol>
